This project is an experiment in implementing a animated graph of nodes moving between various stages and creating a network of visited locations reflecting the state changes. The current state is just an initial push to git of the code.

A few notes about the current state :
* This project is the result of an experiment for the idea of a animated node state graph.  Currently it lacks docs and is quite organized.  It is being rewritten in typescript as a new project [here](https://github.com/markmckellar/walkers)
* It is implemented in JavaScript.  I does make use of the [class declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).  With that being said it will likely not run on older versions of IE (I don't generally run IE but I know it fails on IE11 and below). I have tested it on the current versions of chrome and firefox as of March-2018.
